# 🗂️ Navigation Guide for Dataset Download

This project uses the Cats vs Dogs dataset from Kaggle.  
Here’s how you can get it inside your project folder.

## 📥 Steps

1. Make sure you have `kaggle` installed:
   ```bash
   pip install kaggle
   ```

2. Setup your Kaggle API:
   - Go to [Kaggle Account Settings](https://www.kaggle.com/account)
   - Create a new API token → This will download `kaggle.json`
   - Place it inside:  
     **Windows:** `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.kaggle\kaggle.json`  
     **Linux/Mac:** `/home/<YourUsername>/.kaggle/kaggle.json`  

3. Run the script inside `src/`:
   ```bash
   python src/download_data.py
   ```

4. After running, your dataset will be extracted into the `dataset/` folder.

## ✅ Done!
Now you can use the dataset with the notebooks or model training scripts.
